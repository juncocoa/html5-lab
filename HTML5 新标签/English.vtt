Today you have many ways to manage your files with the cloud.

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.749
Some services let you sync files so you have access from all your devices.

3
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.099
Others let you share files.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.550
And still more let you work together online.

5
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:17.200
But now there's one that lets you do it all.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.500
Welcome to Microsoft SkyDrive.

7
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.400
Meet Stephen.

8
00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:25.500
He's a food blogger and SkyDrive user.

9
00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:29.770
Stephen has just ordered the best pizza he's ever had.

10
00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:33.030
He uses his phone to snap pictures and jot down notes

11
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:34.780
while he happily munches away.

12
00:00:34.781 --> 00:00:38.880
After he's done he grabs a coffee nearby to write his review.

13
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:40.440
When he opens his laptop

14
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:44.350
his photos and notes are automatically synced so he can jump right in.

15
00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:49.125
He even remembers a picture he took in Italy that would be perfect for the story.

16
00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:51.130
He knows it's not in his SkyDrive

17
00:00:51.131 --> 00:00:54.300
but he can still fetch it from his PC at home.

18
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:56.170
Stephen finishes a draft

19
00:00:56.171 --> 00:00:57.600
and shares it with his friends.

20
00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:59.460
They make comments

21
00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:02.900
and he wraps up the story and posts it for the world to see.

22
00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:07.510
With SkyDrive Stephen can always find his files when he needs them.

23
00:01:07.511 --> 00:01:10.510
If only it were that easy to find great pizza.

24
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.800
Microsoft SkyDrive.

25
00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:14.710
Now you can access files from anywhere

26
00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:16.250
share them with others

27
00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:17.920
work together online

28
00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:20.580
and even fetch things from your PC at home.
